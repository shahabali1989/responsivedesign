      The weather is mostly pleasant and some of us can get away with light clothing. However it is  highly recommended that you take extra layers of clothing especially if you plan to go to higher parts of the valley or to the ski resorts where it is quite cold. Always take the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Gloves</li>
        <li>Jacket</li>
        <li>Other accessories to cover your ear</li>
      </ol>
